# Battle Completion Worker

A Google Cloud Run service for automatic battle completion and management in the NewsCast Debate application.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### First Time Setup

1. **Run the setup script** (one-time only):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Enable required Google Cloud APIs
   - Create secrets for environment variables
   - Set up IAM permissions

### Regular Deployments

After the initial setup, deploying changes is as simple as:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This single command will:
- Build and push the Docker image
- Deploy to Cloud Run
- Test the deployment
- Show deployment information

## üìã Available Commands

### Deployment Commands
- `npm run deploy` - Full deployment (build + deploy + test)
- `npm run deploy:build` - Build and push Docker image only
- `npm run deploy:run` - Deploy to Cloud Run only
- `npm run deploy:full` - Build and deploy (no testing)

### Testing Commands
- `npm run test:health` - Test health endpoint
- `npm run test:status` - Test status endpoint with API key

### Monitoring Commands
- `npm run logs` - View recent Cloud Run logs

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload
- `npm start` - Run in production mode locally

## üîß Manual Script Usage

You can also use the deployment script directly:

```bash

./scripts/deploy.sh deploy

# Build only
./scripts/deploy.sh build

# Test deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh test

# View logs
./scripts/deploy.sh logs

# Show deployment info

## üîÑ Workflow for Code Changes

1. **Make your code changes**
2. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
4. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
